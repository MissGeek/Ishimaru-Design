WARNING : Consider this as a development version, for many bugs and security flaws might still be present.

I developed this CMS for my own needs, but I decided to publish the sources on Github for the following reasons :
- It's easier te track bugs if we are several geeks to track them.  When you're spending your time checking your own code, you might miss some details.
- People that are more used to FluxBB can give suggestions.
- As many people want features like the ones I implemented, why not making the community benefit of it ?
